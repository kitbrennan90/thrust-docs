# Authentication

We use HTTP header authentication using Bearer tokens. To get started, visit the [API credentials section of your ThrustCarbon account](https://www.thrustcarbon.com/account/api-credential) to obtain your API key.

To authorize your request, set the `Authorization` header to `Bearer {your-api-key}`.

For example, if your API key was *weiuh8b9hw*, then your Authorization header would look like `Authorization: Bearer weiuh8b9hw`

Please visit this page to learn more about Bearer authorization: https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/
