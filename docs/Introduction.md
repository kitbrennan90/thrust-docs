# Introduction

The ThrustCarbon APIs let you interact with your ThrustCarbon account. Please start by reading the authentication section.

Once you have an API key, please try sending requests directly from the documentation using the 'Try it now' button on each API route's page.

> **Your ThrustCarbon account manager is here to help.** If you have an API questions or concerns please reach out to your account manager and they will forward your question onto the right person.

### Ready to get started?

Terrific. First get your API Token from your Thrust Carbon account (once you are logged in, click the menu in the top right hand corner and select 'API Credentials').

Now head on over to the [Project: Create](https://stoplight.io/p/docs/gh/kitbrennan90/thrust-docs/calculator/calculator.v1.json/paths/~1projects/post?srn=gh/kitbrennan90/thrust-docs/calculator/calculator.v1.json/paths/~1projects/post) endpoint, click 'Try It' and create your first endpoint.

Using the ID of your created project, you can add some segments using the [Segment: Create](https://stoplight.io/p/docs/gh/kitbrennan90/thrust-docs/calculator/calculator.v1.json/paths/~1projects~1%7BprojectId%7D~1segments/post?srn=gh/kitbrennan90/thrust-docs/calculator/calculator.v1.json/paths/~1projects~1{projectId}~1segments/post) endpoint.
