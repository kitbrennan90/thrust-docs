title: 'Segment: Base'
description: |-
  A segment is a thing that can have a carbon impact, for example this might be a flight, a hotel stay, or a delivery.

  This base is extended by each segment type...

  **We suggest looking at the documentation for each segment type to learn the correct structure for that segment.**
